2.1.4
 - Qlik radio button -visualization - fix for search settings, search menu was hidden
2.1.3
 - Fixes for Cloud / SaaS Qlik for field hiding, remove full screen and many others - especially important remove Insight Advisor and Story telling -functions are working again. :)
 - Cloud / SaaS version of Qlik has multiple changes in its HTML and some modifications SFS can do might still miss these changes. Qlik's HTML coding style has been changed to some how confusing manner. Some elements have id selectors, some have classes or just attributes and many don't have any, inline CSS seems to be there more than before. This version of SFS will return many features of SFS back in use with Cloud.
2.1.2
 - Minor change in getApp call
 - Field sanitization with value 2 will sanitize only <script
2.1.1
 - Fix for hover title in drop down select
2.1.0
 - Option to enable text field sanitization which will remove for example Javascript and other HTML characters. This is done by modifying source code. So every time SFS is updated, the option must be re-enabled. 
   - To enable: Edit the extension source code inside the zip file: On the 4. line of properties.def.js set value to 1 in "var useSanitize = 1;" Default value is 0.
   - The parameter is located in source code so that the developer with Qlik UI cannot change the setting
 - Add more padding options to select (sorry, should be text instead of dropdown)
2.0.14
 - Fix for other SFS object update when some selections are done in full screen
2.0.13
 - Context menu location change
 - Extra attribute for HTML standard input
2.0.12
 - Fix for select only one -functionality.
2.0.11
 - Mobile settings to own section in properties
 - Fix for mobile scroll. Was not shown by default. Can be disabled with scroll disable option.
2.0.10
 - Minor changes
 - Select2 fixes as suggested by vbakke
2.0.9
 - Fix for search with checkboxes and others
2.0.8
 - Option to remove variable barckets and double quotas from shown variable. This is needed when variable control is used to select values
 - If "Select defaults once" and there is some selection before defaults are selected and then selections are removed, defaults are considered to be already selected once. So no re-selection happens when initial selection has been cleared.
 - Due to lack of data update of Storytelling there is now a new option to hide just the Storytelling button from the toolbar
2.0.7
 - Minor fix for cloud
 - Fix for dragging selection - The first element with dragging was not selected - now it will!
 - Select2 library update

2.0.5
 - Alternative overlay implementation which will fill whole object.
2.0.4

2.0.3
 -  Disable toggle mode -option. This is actually fix for case when Qlik has "Always one selected value" - set, now this old issue is finally fixed! You have to set extension to work with out Toggle mode.
2.0.2
 - Fix for Global object background with newer Qlik version and cloud
 - Fox for Global object axis color change (newer Qlik version have different kind of way to set colors) Both old and new version should be supported now.
2.0.1
 - Dropdown and select2 have possibility to create sections group labels with special notation in variable settings like ##firstvaleus;1;2;3;4;##secondvalues;5;6;7;8
2.0.0
 - Option to remove clear button from search
 - Minor fixes
 - Remove full screen option will default in new objects to true, a wish from the Qlik Pre-sales. :)
 - Hover color and font settings were hidden because of code typo. So element hover background and font colors can be again defined.
 - Global option to set (many of) the colors and paddings of all SFS objects on a sheet. So you can use one object to control some settings of all SFS objects. No need to configure each separately.
1.9.31
 - Search only visualization fix if two or more instances on one sheet
1.9.30
 - Hide from selections bar - fix, if a function is used in the field name or for someother reason = mark is in the beginning
1.9.29
 - Multiword searchonly visualization improvements: If over 100 search terms, search happens only after pressing enter. Search can be set to exact-mode within search settings. It is faster, whole word comparison, if you have to select thousands of elements. Normal search searches for the occurance of the string as Qlik does.
 - Search only visualization will allways parse "Excel" styled copy-paste data
1.9.28
 - Global option to remove zoom efect from mobile view. This makes selecting and interacting with graphs and tables so much faster in mobile.
1.9.27
 - Search only visualization - will show search box only, won't draw elements. This is usefull for fields with high number of elements and when there is a need to select great amount of them. For example by copy-pasting from Excel etc. Works also with delimited string. Limitation: Won't count duplicates in multiword case correctly while searching.
 - Mobile header, search field and footer hiding options in Global settings.
 - Faster search, ESC key handling
 - Excel search may have also delimited data if delimiter is set. So both settings can be enabled at the same time.
1.9.26
 - Sheet background extra HTML will be cleaned when leaving sheet.
1.9.25
 - Sheet title hiding fix
 - Alternative way to set sheet background CSS. This one allows to use background with extended sheet functionality so that background will stay with the moves of the grid.
 - IE 11 support for search - thanks to github user ahmednuaman for pointing the issue!
 - Global: Sheet background extra HTML element - experimental feature to have custom HTML on document background.
  - Try for example this: '<div style="background-color:green; width:100%;height:100px;"></div> <div style="background-color:#A29723; width:calc(100% - 8px);height:calc(100% - 100px); border:4px solid green;"></div><div style="position:fixed; bottom:20px; left:25px; background-color:#d7d7d7;color:#ee1145;padding:10px;border-radius:10px;z-index:1300;">Notice! There is this kind of info box</div>'
1.9.24
 - Excel copy-paste multisearch feature. Get a list of elements from excel, in vertical or horizontal way and copy paste it to SFS search field. Feature can be enabled from settings.
 - Improvements to search field visuals
1.9.23
 - Top padding was mising from the element. Because idea is not to break legacy versions, there is also now more modern way to set padding of the visualization with custom padding field.
1.9.22
 - Bug fix for overlay and new multiword search
1.9.21
 - User requested feature: Copy-paste multivalue search. You can define separator character for search field so that you can copy-paste multiple values to be searched. For example set separator to ; and type into SFS search box London;Paris;Barcelona;New York;Helsinki and those cities will be selected (Wildcards are not supported.)
 - Overlay functionality. Create a canvas on top of selector to prevent selecting.

1.9.17
 - Bug fix: If default value with variable is used it might cause infinite loop and flickering.  Tip: Do not use variable default, set variale value hard coded instead.
1.9.16
 - In Mashups variable might not have been updated correctly with latest Qlik Sense versions
1.9.15
 - Fix for search icon. Since latest Qlik Sense versions Full screen icon was overlapping search icon. This is first quick fix for this issue.
